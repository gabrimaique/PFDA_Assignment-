# Programming for Data Analysis

### Project Description

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:

**Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
**Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
**Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
**Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### Assignment Brief:

Producing a dataset that represents an event that can be measured in the real world was the aim of this research. The Brazilian presidential election was the occasion I chose. I chose to investigate if social class and regional divisions in Brazil affected electors' choices.


### Running a Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter is a Python package and does not require importation from Python packages. It is commonly run from the machine command line.

To launch a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal/command line and navigate to the directory where you have saved the pulled jupyter notebook. By typing the command jupyter notebook into your terminal/command line, an instance of jupyter will be created on a local server.

When jupyter notebook has been called from your terminal/command line, a browser window should open showing the Jupyter Notebook interface. If it does not, you can copy the URL presented in the terminal/command line, and paste this into your browser's address bar.

Once you have accessed the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can view the files in the current directory. Clicking on the files will open them. Jupyter notebook files are identifiable by their notebook icon (within the Jupyter Notebook interface and by the file extension .ipynb

To close the notebook, terminate the browser tab by clicking the "X" in the top right corner. To stop the instance on the local server and shutdown the jupyter kernel, in the terminal/command line press control-C.

The above steps should allow for the jupyter notebook to display automatically (assuming the prerequisites have been met). Jupyter Notebooks can also be rendered by pasting the URL presented in the terminal/command line on the site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
